# Blogz

Blogz is the big, end-of-unit assignment for Unit 2 of LaunchCode. The application allows users to sign up, view a dynamically updating blog 
list (with pagination), create new posts under their own username, view recent entries, and view other users and how many posts 
they've made on the nicely-styled front page. As of right now, the app is best viewed in the latest version of Chrome. 

The most recent build can be seen at https://tinyblogio.herokuapp.com/.
